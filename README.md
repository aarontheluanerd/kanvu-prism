# Kanvu Prism

this is just a repo that hosts some .rbxm files

feel free to use them for your own roblox projects (it fits well with roblox OS games)
these (the browser & webview) are open-source, if you're going to use them, credit at the very least the WebView, I don't care if it is on an obscure "browser://about" page, just the webview version at the very least works fine.

the browser works as an example of how to implement the webview correctly, and using it as a base for your own "intranet" browsers is fine.

## Browser Features

- Page history per tab *(somehow uncommon with roblox browsers)*
- Built-in Image viewer, Audio & Video Players *(for use with rbxassetid://, rbxasset:// and rbxtemp://)*
- Integrated context menu
- Easy way to integrate new built-in tabs

## WebView Features

- Flexible and customizable functions for different events
- Translate Frames to Prism Datasets with the same module

## How to use

WebView: idk figure it out lmao (it's very simple)

Browser: Just drop it somewhere you like, don't forget to add the "HTTP" folder in ReplicatedStorage with "GET" and "POST" RemoteFunctions; also make sure to enable sandboxed elements.

#### one recommendation

I'm open-sourcing a "DNS" script w/ a simple site router thingy, you can use it when integrating prism but feel free to make your own DNS. [Link Here](https://example.com)
